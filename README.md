# SimSims
This is the SimSims repository for DV1582 project OU3 by Emil Karlstr√∂m.

## How to run
Simply clone the repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary python packages. Simply run `__main__.py` after that and it should all work without any issues.

This build of SimSims is built based on pygame in order to get a simulation with semi-animated animations, if there's such a thing as a semi-animated animation. 

From what I've found, it's fully thread-safe and is indeed multithreaded.
